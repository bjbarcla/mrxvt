Q:  How to build mrxvt, since I cannot find the configure script as usual!?

A:  Have you read the INSTALL file?

-----

Q:  I just upgraded to mrxvt-0.5.x, and feature XXX doesn't work anymore.

A:  Don't panic! Something is possibly different in the latest release.

    The following are the changes you need to be most wary of when upgrading to
    mrxvt-4.x to 0.5.x:

	1. Background tinting works differently when compiled with XRender
	   support (enabled by default in 0.5.0). Now if you want your
	   background tinted to a specific color, you need to set the tintColor
	   resource to that color, and NOT the mask (as you had to in 0.4.x).
	   Specifically, if you want a dark tint, then set tintColor to #000000
	   (in 0.4.x you would set it to #ffffff).

	   Also keep in mind that very bright colors (e.g. #ffffff) are not very
	   transparent and not good for tinting.

	2. The default terminal name is now "rxvt" and not "xterm". On systems
	   with badly configured termcap / terminfo entries for "rxvt", this
	   will cause NUMEROUS ncurses based programs to behave very badly
	   (including bash!). If you have any problems, ask your Linux vendor to
	   fix this! Or wimp out and set the termName resource to "xterm" in
	   your ~/.mrxvtrc

	3. The old "hotkey" feature has been disabled. The new "macro" feature
	   in 0.5.0 extends the functionality of the old "hotkey" feature.

	4. The menu syntax for actions from 0.5.x is incompatible with the
	   syntax from earlier versions. See the man page for details.

	5. The keysym resource is disabled by default (use macros instead).

	6. A few default key-bindings were changed (mainly to adhere to the
	   convention that terminal programs should use Ctrl-Shift modifiers for
	   all it's shortcuts, and let the window manager / child process use
	   other modifier combinations).
	   
	   For example the Shift+Left / Shift+Right macros to switch tabs are
	   enabled ONLY in the primary screen (i.e. they will not work when you
	   are running Vim). Vim uses Shift+Left/Right to move between words, so
	   we do not override this behaviour in Vim.
	   
	   Read the man page and /etc/mrxvt/mrxvtrc for a complete list and
	   description of the macros defined in 0.5.x.

	7. A few escape sequences (controlling creation / movement of tabs) have
	   been disabled for security reasons. The functions can of course be
	   accessed using keyboard macros or the popup-menus.

	8. Escape sequences generated by function keys / modified cursor keys
	   have now been changed to produce exactly the same escape sequences as
	   Xterm does. (If you don't like this, then undefine the macro
	   XTERM_KEYS in src/feature.h). As a result of this, to get Ctrl+Left /
	   Right working in your shell, change ~/.inputrc the way you would for
	   Xterm (not rxvt). This is described later on in this FAQ.

	9. The option --tabShell, --cmdInitTabs have been removed. The options
	   --initTermNum and --vt%d.xx have been marked as obsolete.

	   Mrxvt-0.5.0 has a new "profile" feature intended to replace the above
	   options. Here settings are associated to a "profile" instead of a
	   tab. Tabs can be created on demand with any desired profile. (The
	   earlier design led to some unresolvable bugs when the user moved
	   tabs). Migrating to profiles is easy:

	       1. Replace the old vt%d.xx resources with profile%d.xx. remember
		  that the profile%d resources refer to the PROFILE number, and
		  not the TAB number.

	       2. To open a new tab with profile number N use the macro "NewTab
		  -N". E.g.

		    Mrxvt.macro.Ctrl+Shift+F1:  NewTab -1
		    Mrxvt.macro.Ctrl+Shift+F2:  NewTab -2
		    Mrxvt.macro.Ctrl+Shift+F3:  NewTab -3
		    Mrxvt.macro.Ctrl+Shift+F4:  NewTab -4

	       3. Finally replace your initTermNumber option with
		  initProfileList. The argument to initProfileList is a comma
		  separated list of profiles you want opened in new tabs on
		  startup.

    A more complete list of changes is in the ChangeLog, and in the Subversion
    logs.

Q:  I do not have root privilege on my system. Can I install mrxvt, and what are
    the restrictions if I install it as normal user?

A:  Surely you can install mrxvt without root privilege. You can configure mrxvt
    with --prefix=/home/youraccount and install it. Or you can simply copy the
    mrxvt program to anywhere you wish. Mrxvt only requires setuid root in order
    to write to utmp/wtmp/lastlog. If you do not have root privilege, you will
    only lose this feature.
