=General=
==Configuration==

Probably the simplest step you can take is to make sure it's not just a configuration problem. Comment out the likely suspects or, for a completely blank slate, try
{{{
 mrxvt -cf /dev/null &
}}}
to spawn a new instance with compiled-in defaults. If the problem goes away, it's a configuration problem. Even if it doesn't go away, it may manifest differently and provide clues as to what the problem is.

==Version==

Next, you could make sure you're running the [Downloading latest version]. It may be a bug that's already been fixed. You could even checkout the very latest code from subversion, which may have fixed the problem (though it may have introduced others ;) ).

=TERM=

As mentioned on [Upgrading Upgrading], frequently the problem is with term{info,cap} configuration. To quickly test this out, try
{{{
 mrxvt -tn xterm &
}}}
or other TERM values. If there is a term{info,cap} problem, in addition to distro-specific steps, you might also try the *rxvt.term* files included in the distribution.

=Specific=
(FIXME: add specific 'I have problem foo; use solution bar' items.)
