    Mrxvt version 0.3.13 is released! This is a major bug fix release. Sorry to disappoint you that we could not reach 0.4.0 right now. I know you are eagerly waiting for the magic number 0.4.0. :p The delay is because a major bug was found and thus we need more test on the fix. In particular, please open multiple tabs simultaneously and let each tab do some kind of busy job that refreshes the screen constantly, e.g., `wget --progress=dot big.file`. Then switch to another tab and work in it to see if there is any misbehavior, like crashes (yes, not kidding ;-)), slow response (expected if your machine is slow!!!), etc. If you meet crash, please send me your mrxvt binary and coredump so that I can debug it. Be sure to build mrxvt with debug support. I really hope 0.4.0 is rock solid so that I can concentrate on 0.5.x development branch after releasing it.

    Mrxvt version 0.3.12 is released! This is a major bug fix release - see the long fix list in ChangeLog. If everything goes well, it will be the last testing release before we reach 0.4.0.

    Happy new year, everyone! It has been quiet for a while since mrxvt 0.3.11 was released, however it does not mean the development has stalled. ;-) Please be patient, we need a slight longer time for testing before the last testing release is out.

    Mrxvt version 0.3.11 is released! This release is a major bug fix release. Lots of problems are fixed, like compile error, terminal hanging, off-focus fading bug, session crashes, etc. Please test it throughly and report any bugs. If everything goes well, we will release 0.3.12 as the last testing release (like 0.4.0 beta) and reach 0.4.0 after that.

    Mrxvt version 0.3.10 is released! This release aims to be a bug fix release, but some new features are added as well. The most significant new feature is that the keyboard shortcuts are now configurable! So if you do not like a default keyboard shortcut or would like to define your own shortcuts, you can do it now in the configuration file. Sorry we do not reach 0.4.0 at this release. Though I am using mrxvt everyday and it seems pretty stable, I would like to delay a stable release (0.4.0) till more people have throughly tested it.

    Mrxvt version 0.3.9 is released! This release is a bug fix release, though some new features are still added as requested.
November 17, 2004
    Today I receive Linux Magazine issue 12 of 2004 from ASCII Co. of Japan. There is an article in it introducing mrxvt to the Japanese Linux users. Unfortunately, I do not understand Japanese though I can guess some meaning from the Chinese characters in the article. ;-)

    Mrxvt version 0.3.8 is released! This release introduces the support of true translucent window, holding exited terminal, input broadcasting, different text shadow mode. It also fixes lots of bugs (see the long ChangeLog). From now on, we will focus on stablizing the code instead of adding significant new features. Hopefully we can reach a stable branch at 0.4.0 very soon!

    Mrxvt version 0.3.8 is delayed since I found some serious bugs at the last moment! Please do not worry. By fixing the bugs, I realize now it is easy to implement some functionality, like broadcasting. :-) But the scrolling has become horribly slow. I am trying to figure out the reason. New release will come soon.

    Mrxvt version 0.3.1 is available! This release adds back features like off-focus fading and background color tinting. It also adds new features like transparent scrollbar/menubar/tabbar.

    Sorry folks, my sourceforge e-mail address listed in the AUTHORS/configure.ac file of version 0.3.0 is wrong (fixed in CVS)! Please refresh the project homepage and fetch the new e-mail address on the left panel if you want to contact me! Thanks!
September 15, 2004
    Mrxvt version 0.3.0 is available! This release is based on rxvt 2.7.11 CVS, so the name is changed to mrxvt in order to avoid confusion with multi-aterm. Color background tinting is missing. XIM support still needs debugging. But, it's usable now! Please try it out and send me bug reports!
August 22, 2004
    Version 0.2.0 is available! This release adds support to multichar sets, like Simplified Chinese (GB) and Korea. This branch is considered as the stable branch, and only bug fixes and portability code will be added in the future. New features, e.g., XIM support will be introduced in the development branch, which will be based on rxvt CVS.
August 17, 2004
    Version 0.1.9.1 is available! Now you can change the title of tabs dynamically through escape sequences or hotkeys. This release also fixes a problem in transparent background. It is close to the stable release! Future development will focus on portability on other platforms.

    Multi-aterm version 0.2 is available here with jpeg/png support. However several things fixed in materm are still broken. I will incorperate his new code in the materm soon. Stay tuned.
