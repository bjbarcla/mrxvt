0.4.2 to 0.5.0
\-----------------------------------
Gautam Iyer <gi1242@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Bug Fixes:
		1. Bug #1301269: Make ACS graphics / line drawing characters work
		   under Xft.
		2. Bug #1337635: Made ColorBD/HL work under Xft.
		3. Fixed pseudo-transparency when the root background is tiled on the
		   desktop.
		4. Numerous fixes to options to match the documentation (see CVS
		   logs).
		5. Partially fixed "transparentForce" option (see man page).
		6. Enabled pointer blank under Xft.
		7. Fixed text shadow.
		8. Enabled Xft with menus.
		9. If we're unable to exec the shell (or command specified), print an
		   error message and exit gracefully. (Thanks to Eygene Ryabinkin).
	   10. Fix crash after XIM quits. (Thanks to Gary Zhang for pointing it to
		   us, and attach the patch).
	   11. Fix XIM preedit problems (Thanks to Yoshihiko Kashio for the
	       patch), including:
           - wrong calculation of the preedit area size with hide/show 
		   bars
           - updating the size of the preedit area with resizing window
           - updating the fontset of the preedit area with changing
		   font size
           - the linespace of the preedit area is not configured
           - the preedit character is not drawn on the font baseline
           - clean up codes related to XIM
	   13. Fix compile on cygwin by implementing strcasestr.
	   14. Added a macro XTERM_KEYS to feature.h. If defined, then modified
		   function keys will send the same escape sequences as Xterm.
	   15. Fixed DEC sequences sent by the numeric keypad.

	* Enhancements (Performance):
		1. Reduced memory (xresource) usage under pseudo-transparency.
		2. Made performance improvement to expose events (especially under
		   Xft). Dragging some other window over mrxvt no longer causes
		   any flicker :).
		3. Decreased CPU usage when not focused.
		4. Rewrote tabbar drawing routines to eliminate flicker on expose.
		5. Optimized screen drawing routine with "caching": Causes notable
		   performance improvement under Xft.

	* Enhancements (Appearance / Features):
		1. Updated documentation! (Includes shiny new almost complete man
		   page).
		2. Make tabbar apearence more intuitive: Use itabBackground instead of
		   tabBackground for the background of the tabBar so that the active
		   tab stands out better.
		3. Make highlighted tabs stay highlighted until activated.
		4. Fixed borderless windows (thanks to Jonathan Black for the patch).
		5. Added popup menus. Ctrl left/right click pops up menus.
		6. Right click on tabbar now pops a menu listing all tabs.
		7. Rewrote tabbar drawing routines. Tabs now have rounded tops. Also
		   made the active tab bigger than the others (like Konsole).
		8. When clearing the primary screen, we move the text into the
		   scrollback buffer (instead of discarding the information
		   completely). Thanks to Sabit Sayeed for the suggestion.

	* New features:
		1. Added option -htb (--highlightTabOnBell) to highlight inactive tabs
		   only when a bell sounds.
		2. Added option -mtw (--maxTabWidth) to set the maximum displayed with
		   of each tab.
		3. Added option --smoothResize to resize the window in pixel
		   increments instead of by char. Useful for fullscreen / maximizing.
		   Requires frills.
		4. Added option --fullScreen to make window fullscreen.
		5. Made feature --enable-smartresize into option --smartResize. Make
		   smart resize aware of window manager decorations. Requires frills.
		6. Added option -aht (--autohideTabbar) to automatically hide the
		   tabbar if there is only one tab, and show it if there are more than
		   one tabs open.
		7. Added a "hard reset" hotkey. Thanks to Pavel Gorshkov for the
		   patch.
		8. Added --enable-xrender compile time option to use XRender alpha
		   blending to tint the background under pseudo transparency.
		9. Enabling tinting transparent tabbar / menubar with their background
		   colors. Requires XRender.
	   10. Added --bgRefreshInterval option specifying how long we should wait
		   before refreshing our background. This avoids laggy delays while
		   dragging the window.
	   11. Added hotkeys ScrollHome and ScrollEnd to scroll to the beginning
		   and end of the scrollback buffer. Bound these by default to
		   Shift+Home and Shift+End.
	   12. Added option -xftpfn and -xftpsz to specify the name and size of a
		   propotionally spaced font for the tabbar / menubar.
	   13. Added support for Firefox like tabs: All tabs have the same width,
		   and they shrink as tabs are added. Requires xftpfn
	   14. Added option -mvt to determine the minimum number of tabs to keep
		   visible.
	   15. Added CloseWindow hotkey and escape sequence.
	   16. New tabs now open in the current working directory of the active
		   tab.
	   17. The "hotkey" feature from mrxvt-0.4.2 has now been replaced with
		   a "macro" feature. This reduces the code size slightly, and
		   provides added functionality.
	   18. Implemented a "ToggleMacros" function to toggle using keyboard
		   macros. Renamed options "-dh" and "-ddh" to "-dm" and "-nsc"
		   respectively.
	   19. Added feature to move tabs by dragging.

	* Code cleanup:
		1. Removed the SCROLL_ON_* features. These can all now be implemented
		   using hotkeys.
		2. Cleaned up menubar code.
		3. With -xftpfn the menus now look good :). And you have your precious
		   Control right click menu from Xterm.
		4. Changed default scroll bindings to only work on the primary screen.
		5. Fixed code indent (and added lots of comments) in lots of places.
		6. Removed compiled in keyboard shortcuts (e.g. Ctrl-+ font resizing).
		   This can be done with macros, and the macros method provides added
		   flexibility.
		7. Removed support for getting resources using the X resource
		   database. Now resources are only read using ~/.mrxvtrc.

	* Incompatible Changes:
		1. Tinting works differently with XRender. See -tint in the man page.
		2. The default terminal is now "rxvt" instead of "xterm". This causes
		   trouble on some systems where the "rxvt" termcap / terminfo entries
		   are not correctly setup.
		3. The old "hotkey" feature has been removed. Use the "macro" feature
		   instead.
		4. Mrxvt menus are now incompatible with rxvt. Mainly because the
		   menu-action works similar to the macro actions, which extends the
		   functionality of the old rxvt menus.
		5. Quite a few escape sequences controling tabs have been disabled for
		   security concerns (e.g. creating, closing and moving tabs). All
		   these functions can be accessed through macros, and menus. (The
		   idea is that only interactive users should have access to these
		   functions. 'cat'ing a text file with these escape sequences should
		   not produce such effects.
		6. A few default bindings were changed for consistency (and might be
		   changed again).

	fix bug under XFT that ColorBD/ColorHL are ignored (Sourceforge
		Bug ID# 1337635). Thanks Gautam Iyer for the patch.
	fix screen flicker behavior when pseudo-transparency is enabled
		and mrxvt is off-screen. Also fix a BadMatch error. Thanks
		a lot to Gautam Iyer for the clear explanation of the problem
		and his nice patch.
	fix code of highlighting inactive tabs when they receive some
		output. Add an compile option HIGHLIGHT_TAB_ON_BELL into
		feature.h (disabled by default) so that inactive tabs are
		only highlighted when they receive bell. Also make highlight
		bold. Thanks Joshua Wise for the suggestion and patch.
	fix hot key parsing. Primary flag should not be checked like
		ctrl/meta/shift flag.
	fix button click action on tabbar based on Mark Olesen's patch.
		Now scroll-up and scroll-down clicks (Button4 and Button5)
		will active the previous/next tab. In addition, only clicks
		of Button1 will activate the button functions.
	fix hotkey handler to kill a tab according to Mark Olesen's
		suggestion. That says, if there is only one tab left, we
		shall not kill it to quite the entire terminal. This behavior
		is the same as gnome-terminal.
