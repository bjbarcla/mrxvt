Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) - using fonts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q:  I dislike the default mrxvt font, so I have installed some new fonts, like
    the Verdana font. But when I run mrxvt with option `-fn verdana', mrxvt
    complains that it cannot find the verdana font! What is wrong?

A:  There are two types of fonts in X Window System, the ancient X11 bitmap
    fonts and the new freetype fonts. Mrxvt is capable to use either type of
    fonts.
    
    The X11 bitmap fonts have a special format of names. You can execute command
    `xlsfonts | more' to get a complete list of all X11 bitmap fonts installed
    in your system, and pick one you like. Or you can execute program `xfontsel'
    to pick one, which shows you the look of the font nicely. As you can see,
    the font name is in a special format like the following example. That is why
    mrxvt complains if you only provide the name of the font:

	-adobe-courier-bold-o-normal--14-140-75-75-m-90-iso8859-1

    The freetype fonts are much simpler to handle. You only need to give the
    font family name to `-xftfn' option, there is not a magic format like X11
    font. You can specify other characteristics of the freetype font using other
    related options.

Q:  How to enable freetype font, or, say the XFT support?

A:  You can either use the -xft command line option or the `xft' X resource
    option in the ~/.mrxvtrc file. Check the sample configuration file
    doc/xdefaults-sample.txt and man page for more details.

-----

Q:  After I use freetype font, the text rendering speed seems to slow down a
    lot! How to improve the speed?

A:  Yes, this is a known problem with XFT support. One way to fix it is to
    disable antialias (and autohinting or hinting). But it may make the font
    look ugly. If you do not like it, disable XFT support and use X11 font
    instead.

-----

Q:  After I use freetype font, the line space seems too large. Is there any way
    to narrow down the line space?

A:  This is probably because you have enabled the multichar support when you
    configure mrxvt. In this case, mrxvt loads two fonts, one the normal font,
    and one the multichar font. But due to some problems with XFT library, the
    font loading function does not follow our instructions to load the two fonts
    at specified size. Thus, the size of two fonts are often different. To get a
    better rendering result, mrxvt picks the large size, which is usually the
    multichar font. But normal text are usually displayed using normal font at a
    smaller size. So it appears that the line space is too large. To solve this
    problem, you can specify the multichar font be the same as the normal font
    since mrxvt 0.3.9, or specify the -xftnfm option to not to load multichar
    font, or build mrxvt without multichar support.
