*mrxvt* (previously named materm) is a lightweight, powerful multi-tabbed terminal emulator for the X window system. *mrxvt* is based on rxvt version 2.7.11 CVS and *aterm*. It implements many useful features seen in some modern X terminal emulators (like *gnome-terminal* and *konsole*) but aims to be fast, lightweight and independent of standard toolkits or desktop environments (e.g. Gnome / KDE).
