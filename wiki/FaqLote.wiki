Q:  When I want to use Chinese (or Korea/Japanese) encoding and font, executing
    command `mrxvt -km gb -mfont fontname' is not working! For example, it
    complains that -km is a bad option.

A:  Most probably, you have not enabled gb/big5/kanji/korea options when you
    configure the mrxvt. These options are turned off by default. Reconfigure
    mrxvt to enable these options and rebuild it like the following:

	$ ./configure --enable-cjk --enable-whatever-other-options
	$ make
	$ su
	$ make install

Q:  How do I input Chinese (or Korea/Japanese) in mrxvt?

A:  First of all, you need to to enable the language options for
    Chinese/Korea/Japanese as the above question when you configure mrxvt. You
    also needs to enable the XIM option (--enable-xim).

    Then make sure you have correctly setup and started the XIM server, like
    SCIM, Chinput, fcitx, etc. 

    Next, set the correct locale for mrxvt. You only need to set the environment
    variable LC_CTYPE. But after you set it, make sure that the environment
    variable LC_ALL is not set.

    Finally, set the correct X resources in ~/.mrxvtrc file as the followling.
    Remember the value of inputMethod is case sensitive.

	mrxvt*multichar_encoding: GB
	mrxvt*inputMethod:        SCIM

Q:  I execute mrxvt with CJK encoding and X11 fonts. But sometimes CJK
    characters are not display completely, or there are some extra pixels left
    after the CJK characters.

A:  This is a known issue for displaying CJK characters using X11 fonts. Mrxvt
    requires that the width of each CJK character (mfont) be twice as the width
    of each english character (font). If this condition is not met, mrxvt may
    display CJK characters with some problems. For example, if you choose 6x12
    as the font, and the SimSun font as the mfont, but the width of the SimSun
    font is 13, you will get in trouble. In particular, let us assume that you
    want to display a string "XXabc", where "XX" represents a single Chinese
    character. With SimSun font, the width of "XX" is 13, but mrxvt thinks it is
    12 (= 2 * 6)!!! Thus, when "abc" is displayed, two pixels of "XX" will be
    overwritten by "a"! There are two solutions to this issue. One is to
    carefully choose the font and mfont such that the width of mfont is twice of
    the font. The other is to use freetype font, where we have a special
    handling to avoid this problem.

Q:  Does mrxvt support UTF-8 locale/encoding method?

A:  Not now. This is a planned work and hopefully will be supported in the next
    development branch (0.5.x).

-----

Q:  I use UTF-8 as default encoding method, but mrxvt does not support it. So
    can I start mrxvt with other encoding method, e.g., zh_CN.GB2312 without
    changing the default encoding method?

A:  No problem! You can start mrxvt like the following if you use bash/ksh/sh:

	LC_CTYPE=zh_CN.GB2312 mrxvt &

    If you use csh, try the following

	env LC_CTYPE=zh_CN.GB2312 mrxvt &
