**mrxvt** (previously named materm) is a lightweight, powerful multi-tabbed terminal emulator for the X window system. **mrxvt** is based on rxvt version 2.7.11 CVS and **aterm**. It implements many useful features seen in some modern X terminal emulators (like **gnome-terminal** and **konsole**) but aims to be fast, lightweight and independent of standard toolkits or desktop environments (e.g. Gnome / KDE).
