The mrxvt program is a terminal emulator for X Window System. It provides DEC VT102 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the window system directly.

Mrxvt  is based on rxvt(1) version 2.7.11 CVS, and features most of functionality of rxvt, with a few major enhancements (namely  multiple  tabs, and  transparency). Like rxvt, mrxvt aims to be light, fast, flexible and desktop independent, thus KDE or GNOME are not required.

The primary features of mrxvt include (but are not limited  to)  multiple tabs,  dynamically  changeable  tab titles, customisable command for each tab, input broadcasting, true  translucent  window,  fast  pseudo  trans-parency  with  tinting, user supplied background images (XPM, JPEG, PNG), off-focus fading, text shadow, multiple style (NeXT,  Rxvt,  Xterm,  SGI, Plain)   scrollbars,   XIM,   multi-language  support  (Chinese,  Korean, Japanese), freetype font and logging.
